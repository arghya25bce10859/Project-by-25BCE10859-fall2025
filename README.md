This Project contains python code for a personal expense tracker, which helps in keeping record of currency spent by the user in a given session.
It makes use of 3 functions that are defined in the file.
Input is required at 3 separate stages depending on the choice of the user in what they want to do with the program.
It continues in a loop until the user chooses to exit by simply entering the proper command during the first input stage.
It has defined error checking operations that notify the user if invalid input has been given.
