Problem Statement: Creating a Personal Expense Tracker in Python

Scope of the Project: This Projects scope includes CRUD operations (Allows users to Create, Read, Update, and Delete expense records), Data handling (inputing and changing data), 
Data persistence (The ability of the program to create a database for the saved expenses locally and accessibly), Listing (Displaying all recorded expenses, as sums or wgile categorised), 
Basic Calculations (By showing total expenses for a period, and by changing previously entered expense values in terms of amount), etc.

Target Users: Anyone who is looking for a simple, fast paced, effective, and easy to operate way to keep track of their spendings.

High level features: Usage of Dictionary to store, change, and interact with inputs on a long term basis throughout the session of usage. Usage of defined functions to make the overall code cleaner.
The program itself can keep track of and account for every input made by the user, whether it be additional or subtractional, for long periods of time, and effectively as long as required.
